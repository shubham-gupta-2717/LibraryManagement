        Creates a :ref:`variable object <varobj>` with the specified
        characteristics. This method can be used for binding to PL/SQL IN and
        OUT parameters where the length or type cannot be determined
        automatically from the Python variable being bound. It can also be used
        in :ref:`input <inputtypehandlers>` and :ref:`output
        <outputtypehandlers>` type handlers.

        The ``typ`` parameter specifies the type of data that should be stored
        in the variable. This should be one of the :ref:`database type
        constants <dbtypes>`, :ref:`DB API constants <types>`, an object type
        returned from the method :meth:`Connection.gettype()` or one of the
        following Python types:

        - bool (uses :attr:`oracledb.DB_TYPE_BOOLEAN`)
        - bytes (uses :attr:`oracledb.DB_TYPE_RAW`)
        - datetime.date (uses :attr:`oracledb.DB_TYPE_DATE`)
        - datetime.datetime (uses :attr:`oracledb.DB_TYPE_DATE`)
        - datetime.timedelta (uses :attr:`oracledb.DB_TYPE_INTERVAL_DS`)
        - decimal.Decimal (uses :attr:`oracledb.DB_TYPE_NUMBER`)
        - float (uses :attr:`oracledb.DB_TYPE_NUMBER`)
        - int (uses :attr:`oracledb.DB_TYPE_NUMBER`)
        - str (uses :attr:`oracledb.DB_TYPE_VARCHAR`)

        The ``size`` parameter specifies the length of string and raw variables
        and is ignored in all other cases. If not specified for string and raw
        variables, the value *4000* is used.

        The ``arraysize`` parameter specifies the number of elements the
        variable will have. If not specified the bind array size (usually *1*)
        is used. When a variable is created in an output type handler this
        parameter should be set to the cursor's array size.

        The ``inconverter`` and ``outconverter`` parameters specify methods
        used for converting values to/from the database. More information can
        be found in the section on :ref:`variable objects<varobj>`.

        The ``typename`` parameter specifies the name of a SQL object type and
        must be specified when using type :data:`oracledb.OBJECT` unless the
        type object was passed directly as the first parameter.

        The ``encoding_errors`` parameter specifies what should happen when
        decoding byte strings fetched from the database into strings. It should
        be one of the values noted in the builtin `decode
        <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes.decode>`__
        function.

        The ``bypass_decode`` parameter, if specified, should be passed as a
        boolean value. Passing a *True* value causes values of database types
        :data:`~oracledb.DB_TYPE_VARCHAR`, :data:`~oracledb.DB_TYPE_CHAR`,
        :data:`~oracledb.DB_TYPE_NVARCHAR`, :data:`~oracledb.DB_TYPE_NCHAR` and
        :data:`~oracledb.DB_TYPE_LONG` to be returned as bytes instead of str,
        meaning that python-oracledb does not do any decoding. See
        :ref:`Fetching raw data <fetching-raw-data>` for more information.

        The ``convert_nulls`` parameter, if specified, should be passed as a
        boolean value. Passing the value *True* causes the ``outconverter`` to
        be called when a null value is fetched from the database; otherwise,
        the ``outconverter`` is only called when non-null values are fetched
        from the database.

        For consistency and compliance with the PEP 8 naming style, the
        parameter ``encodingErrors`` was renamed to ``encoding_errors``. The
        old name will continue to work as a keyword parameter for a period of
        time.

        Executes a statement against the database. See :ref:`sqlexecution`.

        Parameters may be passed as a dictionary or sequence or as keyword
        parameters. If the parameters are a dictionary, the values will be
        bound by name and if the parameters are a sequence the values will be
        bound by position. Note that if the values are bound by position, the
        order of the variables is from left to right as they are encountered in
        the statement and SQL statements are processed differently than PL/SQL
        statements. For this reason, it is generally recommended to bind
        parameters by name instead of by position.

        Parameters passed as a dictionary are name and value pairs. The name
        maps to the bind variable name used by the statement and the value maps
        to the Python value you wish bound to that bind variable.

        A reference to the statement will be retained by the cursor. If *None*
        or the same string object is passed in again, the cursor will execute
        that statement again without performing a prepare or rebinding and
        redefining.  This is most effective for algorithms where the same
        statement is used, but different parameters are bound to it (many
        times). Note that parameters that are not passed in during subsequent
        executions will retain the value passed in during the last execution
        that contained them.

        The ``suspend_on_success`` parameter is specific to :ref:`sessionless
        transactions <sessionlesstxns>`. When set to *True*, the active
        sessionless transaction will be suspended when ``execute()`` completes
        successfully.  See :ref:`suspendtxns`.

        The ``fetch_lobs`` parameter specifies whether to return LOB locators
        or ``str``/``bytes`` values when fetching LOB columns. The default
        value is :data:`oracledb.defaults.fetch_lobs <Defaults.fetch_lobs>`.

        ``decimal.Decimal`` values when fetching columns of type ``NUMBER``.
        The default value is :data:`oracledb.defaults.fetch_decimals
        <Defaults.fetch_decimals>`.

        For maximum efficiency when reusing a statement, it is best to use the
        :meth:`Cursor.setinputsizes()` method to specify the parameter types
        and sizes ahead of time; in particular, *None* is assumed to be a
        string of length 1 so any values that are later bound as numbers or
        dates will raise a TypeError exception.

        If the statement is a SELECT query, the cursor is returned as a
        convenience to the caller (so it can be used directly as an iterator

        python-oracledb call. It can also invoke a PL/SQL procedure multiple
        times. See :ref:`batchstmnt`.

        The ``statement`` parameter is managed in the same way as the
        :meth:`execute()` method manages it.

        The ``parameters`` parameter can be a list of tuples, where each tuple
        item maps to one bind variable placeholder in ``statement``. It can
        also be a list of dictionaries, where the keys match the bind variable
        placeholder names in ``statement``. If there are no bind values, or
        values have previously been bound, the ``parameters`` value can be an
        integer specifying the number of iterations. The ``parameters``
        parameter can also be a :ref:`DataFrame <oracledataframeobj>`, or a
        third-party data frame that supports the `Apache Arrow PyCapsule
        <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/
        format/CDataInterface/PyCapsuleInterface.html>`__ Interface.

        In python-oracledb Thick mode, if the size of the buffers allocated for
        any of the parameters exceeds 2 GB, you will receive the error
        ``DPI-1015: array size of <n> is too large``. If you receive this
        error, decrease the number of rows being inserted.

        When *True*, the ``batcherrors`` parameter enables batch error support
        within Oracle Database and ensures that the call succeeds even if an
        exception takes place in one or more of the sequence of bind values.
        The errors can then be retrieved using :meth:`getbatcherrors()`.

        When *True*, the ``arraydmlrowcounts`` parameter enables DML row counts
        to be retrieved from Oracle after the method has completed. The row
        counts can then be retrieved using
        :meth:`getarraydmlrowcounts()`.

        Both the ``batcherrors`` parameter and the ``arraydmlrowcounts``
        parameter can only be *True* when executing an insert, update, delete,
        or merge statement; in all other cases an error will be raised.

        The ``suspend_on_success`` parameter is specific to :ref:`sessionless
        transactions <sessionlesstxns>`. When set to *True*, the active
        sessionless transaction will be suspended when ``executemany()``
        completes successfully. See :ref:`suspendtxns`.

        The ``batch_size`` parameter is used to split large data sets into
        smaller pieces for sending to the database. It is the number of records
        in each batch. This parameter can be used to tune performance. When

        batch.

        Executes a statement against the database. See :ref:`sqlexecution`.

        Parameters may be passed as a dictionary or sequence or as keyword
        parameters. If the parameters are a dictionary, the values will be
        bound by name and if the parameters are a sequence the values will be
        bound by position. Note that if the values are bound by position, the
        order of the variables is from left to right as they are encountered in
        the statement and SQL statements are processed differently than PL/SQL
        statements. For this reason, it is generally recommended to bind
        parameters by name instead of by position.

        Parameters passed as a dictionary are name and value pairs. The name
        maps to the bind variable name used by the statement and the value maps
        to the Python value you wish bound to that bind variable.

        A reference to the statement will be retained by the cursor. If *None*
        or the same string object is passed in again, the cursor will execute
        that statement again without performing a prepare or rebinding and
        redefining.  This is most effective for algorithms where the same
        statement is used, but different parameters are bound to it (many
        times). Note that parameters that are not passed in during subsequent
        executions will retain the value passed in during the last execution
        that contained them.

        The ``suspend_on_success`` parameter is specific to :ref:`sessionless
        transactions <sessionlesstxns>`. When set to *True*, the active
        sessionless transaction will be suspended when ``execute()`` completes
        successfully.  See :ref:`suspendtxns`.

        The ``fetch_lobs`` parameter specifies whether to return LOB locators
        or ``str``/``bytes`` values when fetching LOB columns. The default
        value is :data:`oracledb.defaults.fetch_lobs <Defaults.fetch_lobs>`.

        The ``fetch_decimals`` parameter specifies whether to return
        ``decimal.Decimal`` values when fetching columns of type ``NUMBER``.
        The default value is :data:`oracledb.defaults.fetch_decimals
        <Defaults.fetch_decimals>`.

        For maximum efficiency when reusing a statement, it is best to use the
        :meth:`setinputsizes()` method to specify the parameter types and sizes
        ahead of time; in particular, *None* is assumed to be a string of
        length 1 so any values that are later bound as numbers or dates will
        raise a TypeError exception.

        If the statement is a SELECT query, the cursor is returned as a
        convenience to the caller (so it can be used directly as an iterator
        over the rows in the cursor); otherwise, *None* is returned.

        python-oracledb call. It can also invoke a PL/SQL procedure multiple
        times. See :ref:`batchstmnt`.

        The ``statement`` parameter is managed in the same way as the
        :meth:`execute()` method manages it.

        The ``parameters`` parameter can be a list of tuples, where each tuple
        item maps to one bind variable placeholder in ``statement``. It can
        also be a list of dictionaries, where the keys match the bind variable
        placeholder names in ``statement``. If there are no bind values, or
        values have previously been bound, the ``parameters`` value can be an
        integer specifying the number of iterations. The ``parameters``
        parameter can also be a :ref:`DataFrame <oracledataframeobj>`, or a
        third-party data frame that supports the `Apache Arrow PyCapsule
        <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/
        format/CDataInterface/PyCapsuleInterface.html>`__ Interface.

        In python-oracledb Thick mode, if the size of the buffers allocated for
        any of the parameters exceeds 2 GB, you will receive the error
        ``DPI-1015: array size of <n> is too large``. If you receive this
        error, decrease the number of rows being inserted.

        When True, the ``batcherrors`` parameter enables batch error support
        within Oracle and ensures that the call succeeds even if an exception
        takes place in one or more of the sequence of parameters. The errors
        can then be retrieved using :meth:`getbatcherrors()`.

        When True, the ``arraydmlrowcounts`` parameter enables DML row counts
        to be retrieved from Oracle after the method has completed. The row
        counts can then be retrieved using :meth:`getarraydmlrowcounts()`.

        Both the ``batcherrors`` parameter and the ``arraydmlrowcounts``
        parameter can only be True when executing an insert, update, delete, or
        merge statement. In all other cases, an error will be raised.

        The ``suspend_on_success`` parameter is specific to :ref:`sessionless
        transactions <sessionlesstxns>`. When set to *True*, the active
        sessionless transaction will be suspended when ``executemany()``
        completes successfully. See :ref:`suspendtxns`.

        The ``batch_size`` parameter is used to split large data sets into
        smaller pieces for sending to the database. It is the number of records
        in each batch. This parameter can be used to tune performance. When
        ``Connection.autocommit`` is *True*, a commit will take place for each
        batch. Do not set ``batch_size`` when ``suspend_on_success`` is *True*.
