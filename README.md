# Library Management System

A Flask-based Library Management System integrated with Oracle Database. It allows managing books, members, borrowing, returning, and deleting records. The project features a Bootstrap-based responsive UI with confirmation modals for critical actions.

---

## Features

- Add, view, and manage books
- Add and manage library members
- Borrow books with confirmation
- Return or delete borrowed books
- Flash messages for success/error notifications
- Responsive UI with Bootstrap
- Properly structured templates and modular Flask app

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask (`pip install flask`)
- Oracle Database with user `library_user` (or your own)
- Oracle Instant Client installed
- `oracledb` Python module (`pip install oracledb`)

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/<USERNAME>/LibraryManagement.git`  
`cd LibraryManagement`

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

`python3 -m venv venv`  
`source venv/bin/activate`  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Database Setup

Log in to your Oracle database and create the user and tables:

`CREATE USER library_user IDENTIFIED BY Library123;`  
`GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO library_user;`

Example table for books:

`CREATE TABLE Book (
    BookID NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    Title VARCHAR2(255) NOT NULL,
    Author VARCHAR2(255),
    Publisher VARCHAR2(255),
    Year NUMBER,
    Genre VARCHAR2(100),
    CopiesAvailable NUMBER DEFAULT 1
);`

Table for members:

`CREATE TABLE Member (
    MemberID NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR2(255),
    Email VARCHAR2(255)
);`

Table for borrowed books:

`CREATE TABLE Borrow (
    BorrowID NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    MemberID NUMBER REFERENCES Member(MemberID),
    BookID NUMBER REFERENCES Book(BookID),
    BorrowDate DATE DEFAULT SYSDATE
);`

Update `db_config.py` with your database credentials if different.

On macOS/Linux:

`export FLASK_APP=app.py`  
`export FLASK_ENV=development`  
`flask run`

On Windows:

## Notes

- Make sure Oracle Instant Client is installed and properly configured.  
- Use `.gitignore` to avoid committing `venv/`, `*.pyc`, and other unnecessary files.  
- The app uses Bootstrap 5 for responsive UI and modals.  
- If you want to deploy online, consider using Heroku, PythonAnywhere, or Oracle Cloud.
